Star Rating Prediction using Yelp reviews

I have implemented this project using two approaches for extracting features out of Yelp reviews:
1. TF-IDF approach that gives a feature vector of variable length
2. using word embeddings that gives feature vector of fixed length

After feature extraction, I have compared SVM and Logistic Regression classification methods.
